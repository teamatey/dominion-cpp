# Dominion

This repository is inspired by Oregon State University's CS362 Software Engineering II, in which a buggy cpp-based Dominion project is provided for the sake of applying refactoring, debugging, and source control. While the coursework produced a refactored version of that repository, this was made extracurricularly from scratch.

## Current State

While the code currently supports the logical back-end of Dominion's game mechanics and the functionality of 26 Kingdom Cards, it lacks an interactive front-end, and thus has no method of running.

## Future

This project may be converted to JavaScript for an interactive web application. In addition, the game will feature a Resolution phase that will allow other players to take permitted actions when it is not their turn.
